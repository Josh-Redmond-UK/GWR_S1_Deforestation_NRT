This WORK IN PROGRESS repo implements the method described in Ballere et al (2021) and extends it by adding local parameter estimation for deforestation detection using Geographically Weighted Regression based on ecoregion with  the intention of improving accuracy in a generalisable way. The Results are presented in a jupyter notebook which contains an interactive version of the code used.
